    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <h2>The "We Don't Collect Anything" Edition</h2>
    <div class="last-updated">Last Updated: February 17, 2025</div>

    <p>Hey there! This is probably the shortest privacy policy you'll ever read, but we still made it funny because legal documents are usually about as exciting as watching paint dry.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>What Data We Collect</h2>
        <p>Nothing. Nada. Zero. Zilch.</p>
        <p>We're like that friend who never remembers your birthday – except in this case, it's by design! We don't collect, store, or even think about your personal data. Our app is as forgetful as a goldfish, and we're proud of it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
        <p>Well, this is awkward... We can't use what we don't collect. It's like trying to make a sandwich with an empty fridge.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We can't share what we don't have! Think of us as that person at a potluck who forgot to bring a dish – except we're doing it intentionally and it's actually a good thing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p>Our data storage system consists of <span class="emphasis">*checks notes*</span> absolutely nothing. It's like our servers are practicing minimalism, but they're really, really good at it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the right to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Use our app</li>
            <li>Know that we know nothing about you</li>
            <li>Feel good about both of these things</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>If we ever decide to collect data (which is about as likely as finding a unicorn in your garage), we'll update this policy and let you know. But for now, we'll continue being blissfully ignorant about who you are.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have questions about all the data we're not collecting, feel free to reach out at privacy@brillig.org. We promise to read your email, even though we won't remember your email address!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="footer">
        <p>Remember: In a world where everyone wants your data, we're the app equivalent of someone wearing a blindfold at a party. And we like it that way!</p>
    </div>
